I have been doing my Bachelor's thesis at the [Formal Verification Group](/) under the supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen, where we developed a method for determinizing probabilistic programs while preserving quantities like (bounds on) the (expected) running time and/or expected values.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Peking University.
