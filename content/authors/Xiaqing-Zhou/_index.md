I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the [Formal Verification Group](/) under the co-supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen and Dr. [Xinkui Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zjuzxk). My research interest lies in the intersection of formal methods and operating systems. I develop (semi-)formal techniques for verifying generative intelligent operating systems.
