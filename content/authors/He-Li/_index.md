I have been doing my Bachelor's thesis at the [Formal Verification Group](/) under the co-supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen and Dr. [Jianwei Yin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0001038). The goal of my research is to develop a uniform language for specifying and reasoning about multimodal service regulations.

I am currently a software engineer at IPLUSMOBOT, Hangzhou, China
