I have been involved in research projects on parameterized algorithms in static analysis and differential privacy in database query processing. In particular, during the intern program at RWTH Aachen University, I work on the topic of latticed Craig interpolation under the supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen, where we aim to apply the well-established technique of Craig interpolation to the verification of (possibly infinite-state) probabilistic programs encoding randomized algorithms.
